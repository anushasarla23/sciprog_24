# Practical 3

* This is practical number 3. In this practical, we have approximated the integral function of the tangent function from 0 to 60 degrees using the trapezoidal rule. Then compares this final value with the real value of log(2). In this program we can use different kinds of loops, where we have used while loop in this. Printing the values of the output when the angles are even makes it relevant and includes disparity in order to compute the approximation's precision.

* Command to Compile:
```bash
gcc -o Practical3 practical3.c -lm
```

* Command to Execute:
```bash
./Practical3
```

* Output:
